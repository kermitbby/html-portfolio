<h1>MY MESSING AROUND WITH HTML</h1>

<h2>things i've learnt so far</h2>

<h3>ordered lists and unordered lists</h3>
<ol>
   <li> <h3>this is an example of headers</h3> </li>
   <li>use paragraphs-see below</li>
   <li>other things tbc</li>
</ol>

<p>Can you rework to make the pizza look more delicious can you lower the price for the website? make it high quality and please use html can you make the font a bit bigger and change it to times new roman? 
    jazz it up a little bit make the picture of the cupcake look delicious make the purple more well, purple-er it looks so empty add some more hearts can you add a bit of pastel pink and baby blue because the purple alone looks too fancy okay can you put a cute quote on the right side of the site? 
    oh no it looks messed up! i think we need to start from scratch, for what you've given us is texty, we want sexy is there a way we can make the page feel more introductory without being cheesy needs to be sleeker. </p> 
<p>i don't like the way it looks. Make it sexy can you turn it around in photoshop so we can see more of the front. We have big contacts we will promote you. I need a website. 
    How much will it cost is this the best we can do, yet I need a website. How much will it cost, or we are a startup, for I have printed it out, but the animated gif is not moving. We are your relatives try a more powerful colour, or that's great, but we need to add this 2000 line essay, for what is lorem ipsum? why is the text in spanish?, but this is just a 5 minutes job, or we have big contacts we will promote you</p>
